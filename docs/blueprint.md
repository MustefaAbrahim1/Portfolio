## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of mystery and professionalism, blending well with both dark and light themes. This is inspired by the magical concept of the app.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F0F0) for light mode and dark grey (#333333) for dark mode to provide comfortable contrast and readability.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA), a lighter and less saturated tone that complements the indigo without overpowering it, approximately 30 degrees from the primary.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, for a blend of modern clarity and slight warmth. Headline Font: 'Playfair', serif, is for a more elegant, high-end feel. Playfair is suitable for headlines or small amounts of text. If longer text is anticipated, use 'PT Sans' for body
- Subtle and smooth transitions with Framer Motion to add an element of magic.
- Clean, modern design with a focus on showcasing projects effectively.
